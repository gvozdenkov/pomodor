# Pomodoro time tracker

## Description

I want to make my own time tracking service using the Pomodoro technique. This is an extremely necessary thing for freelancing.

## Functional

- The user can create a Client and a Project and start the Pomodoro timer. After the timer ends, the elapsed time is recorded in the database for that Project.

- Set the hourly cost of work to automatically calculate the cost of the project based on the time spent on it.

- View summary results. How much time was spent on the project. How much time was spent on work per week, month, etc. How much money is earned for each Client or Project.
